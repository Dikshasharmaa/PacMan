# 🎮 My Java Creation! 🕹️

I’m excited to share my latest project—a **Pacman game** 🎮 built from scratch using **Java JFrame**! This was a fantastic learning experience that allowed me to dive deeper into Java programming and develop my skills in **game development**, **GUI design**, and **logic implementation**.

Creating this game taught me the importance of **problem-solving** and **attention to detail**, especially when coding character movements and interactions. 🚀  
Developing the mechanics, such as **life tracking**, **score updates**, and **smooth movement**, was both rewarding and educational.
